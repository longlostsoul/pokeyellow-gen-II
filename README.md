# Pokémon Yellow  #


This is a disassembly of Pokémon Yellow, with:
 All pokemon following
 Pikachu evolvable into Raichu by happiness (min level 16)
 Boy/girl added on
 Running Shoes
 More mons added to the wild for 151 catchability
 Fairy, Dark, Steel added
 Unlimited TMs
 Improved gen 2 style sprites
 
 Warning: There may be a crash at the surf house, haven't tested it yet but was there last time I had everything reverted back this old... (Note: There is a much improved version of this called EvoYellow with Day/Night and new gen pokemons; this is the minimalist version with only 151!)
 
 The following later-gen style type changes:
 Mr.Mime, Clefairy, Jigglypuff fam get added fairy typing like later gens
 Magnemite family Steel
 (Since otherwise there would be no dark types in the game, Alolan typings have been used for 3 mons families)
 Alolan style dark Meowth, dark/steel Persian
 Alolan Dark/Poison Ekans
 Alolan typing Normal/Dark Rattata / Raticate
 

 
 If even the minimal typing changes are disliked, it is easy enough to make your own version, just download and give a make command to cygwin after cd'ing to the appropriate folder. It is also possible to edit it so just Pikachu/Raichu follow, since sprites for other 'mons are fairly limited.
  
  There is also a side branch with even more typing changes, such as Alolan style ice-move possessing blue sandshrew/sandslash, dragon/fire charizard, water/fire goldeen, and psychic/water golduck. In that version some pokemon (Butterfree, Beedrill, Dragonair) also recieved slight statboosts.
  
 TMs/HMs and Moves:
 Cut is now a steel type move, Bite is dark, and a few other move typing changes so that the new typings can actually be enjoyed/played.
 Roar, Whirlwind, and Razorwind have been replaced by moves named Dragonbreath, Fairy Wind, and Silver Wind for greater typing variety.
 In addition, Pay day is dark, and since Cut, Whirlwind, and Razorwind were originally TMs/HMs, there are TMs and HMs with greater type variety now: dark, steel, fairy, and bug.
 

It builds the following rom:

* Pokemon Yellow (UE) [C][!].gbc  `md5: d9290db87b1f0a23b89f99ee4469e34b`

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).
Or just manually download and make with cygwin.
