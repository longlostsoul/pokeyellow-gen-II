# Pokémon Yellow  #

Currently buggy, don't use. I ported over too much code at once. :P

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Yellow, with:
 All pokemon following
 Pikachu evolvable into Raichu
 Boy/girl added on
 Running Shoes
 More mons added to the wild for 151 catchability
 Fairy, Dark, Steel added
 
 The following later-gen style type changes:
 Mr.Mime, Clefairy fam get fairy typing like later gens
 Magnemite family Steel
 Since otherwise there would be no dark types in the game, Alolan typings have been used for 3 mons families:
 Alolan style dark Meowth, dark/steel Persian
 Alolan Dark/Poison Ekans
 Alolan typing Normal/Dark Rattata / Raticate
 
 If the typing changes are disliked, it is easy enough to make your own version, just download and give a make command to cygwin after cd'ing to the appropriate folder. It is also possible to edit it so just Pikachu/Raichu follow, since sprites for other 'mons are fairly limited.
 
 Moves:
 Cut is now a steel type move, Bite is dark, and a few other move typing changes so that the new typings can actually be enjoyed/played.
 

It builds the following rom:

* Pokemon Yellow (UE) [C][!].gbc  `md5: d9290db87b1f0a23b89f99ee4469e34b`
